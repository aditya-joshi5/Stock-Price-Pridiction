# Stock Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
   # Overview
Stock price prediction using machine learning aims to forecast the future value of financial assets traded in the market. This is a complex task influenced by multiple factors such as market trends, investor sentiment, economic indicators, and company performance.

This project utilizes the Linear Regression algorithm to predict stock prices by analyzing historical stock data. The implementation is done in Python using key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

# Understanding Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (stock price) and one or more independent variables (historical price trends). The equation is given as:

Y=mx+c
Where:

Y = Predicted stock price (dependent variable)
x = Historical price data (independent variable)
m = Coefficient (slope) that determines the relationship strength
c = Y-intercept
The goal of the model is to find the best-fitting linear relationship between stock prices over time and use it for future predictions.

# Project Workflow

**Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
Load and clean historical stock price data.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends.

**Data Splitting:**
Divide the dataset into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets.

**Model Training:**
Train a Linear Regression model using historical stock prices.
Compute the best-fitting line that minimizes prediction errors.

**Prediction & Evaluation:**
Test the model on unseen stock price data.
Measure performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
Achieved an accuracy of >99% in predicting stock prices.

# Visualization & Insights

Use Matplotlib to plot actual vs. predicted stock prices.
Provide insights on stock trends based on predictions.
